Please log into your profile and confirm the booking as soon as possible.<br />
Any bookings not confirmed within 24 hours may be reassigned to a different holiday nanny.<br />
<br />
Once you have confirmed your booking you can chat with the family via our online messaging system and ask them any necessary questions.<br />
<br />
Please make sure you confirm the following:<br />
1)	If the child/ren have any allergies, dietary requirements, take medication or have any health conditions.<br />
2)	Directions or guidance on how you can get to the job if you are unsure.<br />
3)	Extra information about the child/ren.<br />
4)	Please tell the family if you have any dietary requirements as they will be providing you with food<br />
5)	Arrange your travel with the family. They should pay for any travel arrangements but may require you to help them to find tickets for flights/ trains etc. If you need assistance with this then please let us know and we can help!<br />
6)	Make sure you ask about sleeping arrangements, The family should provide you with a private room, at their accommodation or within a 10 minute walk<br />
<br />
You are scheduled to work 8 hours a day at the times the family choose. This may change and we ask Tripsitta nannies to be as flexible as possible.<br />
<br />
If the family ask to extend the booking they can book any extra days through the Tripsitta website.<br />
<br />
We would like to remind you that any future requests from Tripsitta customers must continue to be arranged through Tripsitta as stated on your Tripsitta childcare agreement.<br />
<br />
Please be friendly, polite and presentable. We advise planning activities to do with the kids if you can before going to the booking.<br />
<br />
After the booking, the family will be able to leave you a review which will contribute to your overall rating and appeal to future customers.<br />
<br />
We hope the holiday nanny job goes well!<br />
