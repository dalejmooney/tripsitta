Hi {{$name}}<br />
Thank you for your holiday nanny booking with {{$babysitter_name}}<br />
For: {{$start_date_time}} - {{$end_date_time}}<br />
Your booking and payment have been received. {{$babysitter_name}} will check all the details of the booking shortly and confirm. You will then be able to communicate directly with {{$babysitter_name}} using our online messaging service to finalise any extra details.
You will also need to arrange any travel for your holiday nanny to and from your accommodation, organise a private room for your nanny either at your accommodation or within a ten minute walk, and provide food for them during their stay with your family.
<br />
If you need any assistance organising the above please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us for assistance.<br />
<br />
Your nanny will be available to work 8 hours per day at the times of your choice and although we know schedules can change we recommend discussing expected times of work at the beginning of the booking and confirming times for the following day on a daily basis so the nanny has a clear idea of when you need them.<br />
If your family have any special requirements, if there are allergies or medical conditions that your holiday nanny should be made aware of or anything else important for them to know then it is best to advise {{$babysitter_name}} prior to the booking so they can arrive as prepared as possible.<br />
<br />
We hope you are very happy with {{$babysitter_name}} and we will be in touch after your booking to request some feedback from you,<br />
<br />
In the meantime we are here to help if you need us!<br />
<br />
Warm regards,<br />
<br />
The Tripsitta Team
