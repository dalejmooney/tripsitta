Hi {{$name}}<br />
You have just received a booking for:<br />
{{$start_date}} - {{$end_date}}<br />
At<br />
{{$address}}<br />
<br />
Please log into your profile and confirm the booking as soon as possible.<br />
Any bookings not confirmed within 24 hours will be reassigned to a different babysitter.<br />
<br />
Once you have confirmed your booking you can chat with the family via our online messaging system and ask them any necessary questions.<br />
<br />
Please make sure you know the following:<br />
1)	If the child/ren have any allergies, dietary requirements, take medication or have any health conditions.<br />
2)	Directions or guidance on how you can get to the job if you are unsure.<br />
3)	Extra information about the child/ren.<br />
4)	If your booking is for longer than 6 hours or during a meal time, you can check with the family if you should bring yourself a meal or if they will provide you with something to eat.<br />
5)	Please make sure you check how you can get to the booking and back. If you do not have your own transportation or public transport is not running when you finish the job you may be able to request a little extra for a taxi or travel expenses. Please make sure you find out any costs if necessary and tell the family immediately if you do have travel expenses.<br />
<br />
At the end of the booking, if you stay longer than planned, you can put in a request for any extra time in your bookings section. Please do this as quickly as possible, preferably when leaving the job.<br />
<br />
We would like to remind you that any future requests from Tripsitta customers must continue to be arranged through Tripsitta as stated on your Tripsitta childcare agreement.<br />
<br />
Please be punctual, friendly, polite and presentable. We advise planning activities to do with the kids if you can before going to the booking.<br />
<br />
After the booking, the family will be able to leave you a review which will contribute to your overall rating and appeal to future customers.<br />
<br />
We hope the babysitting job goes well!<br />
<br />
If you need any help at all please donâ€™t hesitate to contact the bookings team!<br />
<br />
Best wishes,<br />
<br />
