Hi {{$name}}<br />
We are pleased to inform you that you are now officially part of the Tripsitta team.<br />
Welcome to the childcare revolution!<br />
<br />
As a Tripsitta babysitter you will now have access to fantastic childcare opportunities around the world.<br />
We hope you have many wonderful experiences as part of the Tripsitta family.<br />
<br />
It is now important for you to perfect your profile so you can attract the most enquiries as possible.<br />
Please remember to include some relevant photos, a description of your childcare experience, information about your personality and anything else you feel will be useful in conveying your skills and the essence of who you are to any parents looking for childcare.<br />
<br />
Please update your availability as often as possible so parents have accurate information about when you are free for work and can easily find you. If you move to a different city or country, then please let a member of our team know so we can update your profile.<br />
<br />
As part of the Tripsitta team we also encourage you to share information about Tripsitta to as many people as you can so we can grow and expand and continue to offer you exciting positions, both where you live and abroad.<br />
<br />
We are looking forward to working together and pleased to have you representing Tripsitta!<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />
Emmy Yoshida<br />
(Tripsitta founder)
